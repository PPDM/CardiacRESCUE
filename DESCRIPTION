Description: Coronary artery disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Accurate prediction of 
    "major adverse cardiovascular event" (MACE, comprising cardiac-related death or AMI, and revascularization) 
    can greatly improve patient's survival and quality of life. This R package provides tools for assessing
    one-year risk of MACE for patients with stable angina symptoms who undergo an imaging test for diagnosis 
    of ischemic heart disease, where the image results are used for guiding subsequent treatment.
